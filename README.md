Code and Datasets from the Evaluation of the Web Accessibility of Chinaâ€™s National-Level Museums

The datasets described in this article were collected from our Python scripts, crawled and scraped via two automated tools SiteImprove Accessibility Checker and the WAVE evaluation tool of a total of 145 museum websites scattered across China. The dataset was used for investigating the web accessibility of the national-level museums of China that are ranked top three. A total of 113 variables were obtained out of which the 93 were web accessibility specific variables. Museum specific variables were the number of objects in the collection, number of graded precious artefacts, and annual visitors. Web accessibility specific variables include summary accessibility errors such as contrast errors, alert errors, feature errors, structure, and ARIA. Details of the errors in each of these categories would form the majority of the data points. The datapoints also include language options.
